## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Frontend doesn't auto-start?
**Solution:** Make sure you're in Development mode and frontend folder exists at `SafetyEStopSystem.API\frontend\`

### Sound doesn't play?
**Solution:** 
- Check browser allows autoplay
- Click on page first to enable audio context
- Try Chrome/Edge (best support)

### Can't delete station?
**Solution:** Stations with incidents cannot be deleted (by design). Toggle to inactive instead.

### Print looks wrong?
**Solution:** Use Chrome/Edge for best print results. Ensure "Background graphics" is enabled in print dialog.
